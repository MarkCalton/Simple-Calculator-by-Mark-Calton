This is a program proudly created and tested 100% accurate by MarkCalton, owner and make of this repository. This project is under the GNU GPL v3 license. Have a great day to whoever uses my program! If bugs or miscalculations have been found, pls email me: markcalton19@gmail.com (P.S. If you try to open the calculator (the .bat file) and Windows pops up a window saying that its a potential virus or anything, dont worry, it is NOT a virus. Just check "Don't show this message again" and click "OK" and have fun calculating.)
